// 2000. Reverse Prefix of Word

// Given a 0-indexed string word and a character ch, reverse the segment of word that starts at index 0 and ends at the index of the first occurrence of ch (inclusive). If the character ch does not exist in word, do nothing.

// For example, if word = "abcdefd" and ch = "d", then you should reverse the segment that starts at 0 and ends at 3 (inclusive). The resulting string will be "dcbaefd".
// Return the resulting string.




// Example 1:

// Input: word = "abcdefd", ch = "d"
// Output: "dcbaefd"
// Explanation: The first occurrence of "d" is at index 3. 
// Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "dcbaefd".
// Example 2:

// Input: word = "xyxzxe", ch = "z"
// Output: "zxyxxe"
// Explanation: The first and only occurrence of "z" is at index 3.
// Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "zxyxxe".
// Example 3:

// Input: word = "abcd", ch = "z"
// Output: "abcd"
// Explanation: "z" does not exist in word.
// You should not do any reverse operation, the resulting string is "abcd".



var reversePrefix = function (word, ch) {

    // if ch includes in word
    if (word.includes(ch)) {

        // find index of ch in word
        let index = word.indexOf(ch);

        // copy the string upto the index in word
        let str = word.slice(0, index + 1);

        // reverse the str
        let rev = str.split('').reverse().join('');

        // add rev and remaining string in word
        word = rev + word.slice(index + 1);
    }

    // return string word
    return word;
